This is dog dont use it in production lmao

This is a very basic python script that checks the status of a source dedicated server and restarts it using the pterodactyl panel api.

No support will be provided on setting this up but its here if you want it. Pterodactyl needs to integrate crash dedection and stop saying they wont add game specific features like its a gameserver panel...
